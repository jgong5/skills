`gate_task` leaves out `tests/*/test_make_pdf.py`: those tests need pandoc,
a Chrome-family binary and poppler, which the dev container lacks. A change
to a skill's `make_pdf.py`, `check_pdf.py` or `tutorial.css` runs them where
those tools exist, and its PR states the result and the commit.

A change to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` also runs `claude plugin
validate .` and `claude plugin details <bundle>` (CLAUDE.md, Commands).

Run commands the way `CLAUDE.local.md` says when it exists.
